My motivation for creating this website stemmed from my curiosity and desire to expand my programming knowledge. Prior
to this project I had created multiple applications in different languages such as Java, Python, and C++. However, I also
wanted to experience web development and wasn't sure if schooling would ever touch on the area. I decided to take matter
into my own hands by doing my own research and projects.

This website is built using Jekyll which means I didn't have to completely start from scratch. Through research online I 
learned how to utilize Jekyll to efficiently develop a website. Another positive was Jekyll is very compatible with 
GitHub Pages which allows developers to easily host their websites for free. Although this website is a bit basic, it's 
my very first one! In the future I will likely add to this website as I learn more.

There are two locations on this website where you can read about the different projects that I have done. Under the Pursued
Projects tab you can read summarizes of these projects and what languages they were done in. On the home page I have 
different articles for each project where I go into more detail about the specific project.

Many of the projects displayed are old. I had a lot more free time throughout high school as opposed to college. Much of the
source code for these projects do not follow standard conventions and are quite a mess to look at due to my lack of knowledge
at the time. If I ever add more recent projects the source code for them will be a lot more clean because of what I've learned in
my college classes and because I have been programming longer.
