The third project I will talk about is a Minecraft mod I made with one of my friends. Minecraft has a lot of developer support
making it really easy for programmers to create mods. These mods can change the game in almost any way imaginable. 

We decided to make an extensive mod for a specific Minecraft server that we played on. We chose the name "Nostalgia" because
it sounded cool. This mod did many things such as track statistics, contained custom commands, had a Discord Rich Presence,
and changed many aspects of the game graphically. The mod also included holiday specific events. For example, during
Christmas the player had the option to turn on the song Jingle Bells as background music and allow snow to fall constantly.
The client also had a custom Discord Rich Presence which showed on Discord that the user was playing our version of the game
rather than the original. 

This project also allowed me to play around with GUIs. The custom main menu had custom buttons that replaced the original, 
and we also had a completely separate button window that provided the player with button toggles for all of the mod features.

Similar to the Discord Bot project, this mod utilized multiple APIs at the same time. 

Below is a comparison between the standard Minecraft main menu, and the custom one we made:
