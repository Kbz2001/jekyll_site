Welcome to the Pursued Projects portion of my website! Here you will find summaries of coding projects I have done.
Throughout the years I have taken up a variety of coding projects across a variety of programming languages. Much of my 
motivation for these projects has come from my hobby of playing video games. In no particular order here are my projects 
with snapshots of how they work!

***1.)*** KbzDiscordRP (Discord Rich Presence Detection)
</span>

<span style="color: #f88379">
*Languages Used: JavaScript, HTML*
</span>

<span style="color: #84D55B">
I decided to do this project because I didn't like how Google Chrome had very limited support for Discord's Rich Presence
detection. Essentially this program makes it so whenever the user has Discord active and also has Google Chrome open, Discord
will detect that and display "Google Chrome" as the current game they are playing along with some useful information. For
this particular project I used a similar existing project and have expanded this program to go beyond Google Chrome by 
adding support for other websites.

***2.)*** Arena Brawl Discord Bot (Discord Bot)
</span>

<span style="color: #f88379">
*Languages Used: Java*
</span>

<span style="color: #84D55B">
This was one project that was motivated by one of my hobbies. This Discord bot was centered around a game that I used to play.
The bot was able to interact with the game's API and return data such as the number of people playing. This data was displayed
in Discord which means users didn't have to login into the game to see how many people were on. It also had many other features/minigames
that I created to learn the Discord API.

***3.)*** Nostalgia (Minecraft Mod)
</span>

<span style="color: #f88379">
*Languages Used: Java, Kotlin*
</span>

<span style="color: #84D55B">
This was a project that was motivated by the popular game Minecraft. This program did many things such as implemented macros
to make typing commands easier and also tracked statistics on a specific Minecraft server. We even had a custom main menu
screen for the game. An image of this is shown below.

***4.)*** Kile's Website (w/ Jekyll)
</span>

<span style="color: #f88379">
*Languages Used: JavaScript, HTML*
</span>

<span style="color: #84D55B">
Yep this very website you are viewing! This project was my second attempt at website development. The first attempt I tried
to use ReactJS but realised it was too complicated and too over-the-top for what I was trying to accomplish. This website
was created with Jekyll, a much more simple static site generator which fit my needs a lot more. On top of being easy to
use it taught me the basics of web development.
