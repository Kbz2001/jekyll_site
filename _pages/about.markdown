I currently attend Texas A&M University and am studying to achieve a bachelor's degree in computer engineering.

In my free time I enjoy playing video games, hanging out with friends, and PROGRAMMING!

Throughout this website you will see many personal projects that I have done, as well as witness 
the variety of programming languages that I have learned throughout the years.

Social Medias:

--------------------------------------------------------

You can find me on GitHub:
[GitHub][github-account].

All projects found on here will most likely have their source code uploaded to GitHub.

You can find me on Discord:
ٴٴ#3870

The above tag probably won't work, I glitched Discord with my name (you can see the discriminator and the username are switched) 
which is hilarious, but also prevents people from
being able to add me. If you really want to be added contact me via another social media. I am VERY active on Discord.

You can find me on Instagram:
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kbz2001/).

Not very active on here, but hey it exists.
